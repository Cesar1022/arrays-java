# Arrays in Java
An array in Java is a data structure that allows us to save multiple elements of the same type. The elements are saved in a single variable instead of declaring one variable for each value. Arrays in Java are [reference type](https://www.javatpoint.com/reference-data-types-in-java).

Arrays are stored in consecutive memory locations, once a size is declared for an array, it cannot be changed.

The index for an array starts in 0 and its last position is size-1.
